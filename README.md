# Welcome to my Personal Website
A portfolio-style web application where I explore and improve my front-end and back-end skills using HTML, React.js, CSS, and Python.

## About This Project
This is a personal learning hub where I practice web development by building small, focused components and tools. It's a space to experiment, document progress, and grow as a developer.

## Key Goals
* Improve front-end development using React.js and CSS
* Explore backend functionality with Python (possibly Flask or FastAPI)
* Learn how to integrate different parts of a web application
* Build a showcase of my interests and mini-projects

## Technologies Used
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript (ES6+)
* React.js
* Python 3.x (future backend features)


## Features To Build
Because this is a little bit of a personal project I would like to add a password section here so that only people who have access to the password can access my website!

### Figma Layouts
I would like to add Figma disigns in this section. I am currently teaching myself how to use Figma on an indestry level and would like to have a section where I can showcase different pages and layouts I have developed.

### Mini React Projects
Here I can add different tools and widgets where I can display things that I have built as practice.

- [ ] Clock
- [ ] Calendar with month navigation
- [ ] Habit Tracker
- [ ] Budget Tracker
- [ ] Fun UI experiments (sliders, cards, animations)

## Roadmap
- [ ] Create figma designs for the site in order to retain consistancy across pages
- [ ] Create the main pages using CSS
- [ ] Use React.js to implament the pages
- [ ] Use Python to integrate the website with backend
- [ ] Deploy using Vercel or GitHub Pages
